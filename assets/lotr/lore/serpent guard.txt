当学到近哈拉德的人类时，你很快会听到关于所谓“黑蛇守卫”的传说故事。事实上，它们曾是南蛮子中极强的一股力量，但在我们征服哈拉德后随风而逝了。

这些家伙与寻常守卫不同，事实上他们仅是一种人数极少的战士阶层。
While studying the Men of Near Harad, my good student, you will sooner or later stumble across tales of the so-called "Serpent Guard". 
Indeed, once they were a powerful force among the Southrons, but they have faded away since our glorious conquest of the Harad.

These men were no simple guard, oh no, but in truth a warrior-caste which permitted only very few to serve. 
Fascinating as it may sound, these men owed no allegiance to a single city; rather, they were dispersed amongst 
the many Princes and noblemen, often serving as royal guards, men-at-arms, or advisors.

How the Serpent Guard managed to survive despite the endless infighting among their own people I know not, 
but in time they did grow wealthy and powerful. Indeed it seems that their guild had a hand in unifying the 
Southron tribes against the glorious armies of our King Hyarmendacil... but it was in vain. For the brave men 
of Gondor crushed the Southron savages at the Battles of the Harnen and the Astrasir, before marching on to 
sack the great city they called the Eye of Harad.

And it was there, within the walls of the Eye, where our host slew the last of our foes. 
Among them was the sole remaining chief of the Serpent Guard, who, it is told, died a 
coward's death. After the victory, the amassed riches of the Serpent Guard were confiscated, 
and what few men remained of their caste were disbanded. The end of their Guard marked the 
dawning of a new age for the Southrons, under the enlightened rule of the Kingdom of Gondor. 
Eternal glory to the lands of the White Tree!
